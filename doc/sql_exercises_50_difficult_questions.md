# 50 SQL Questions for Silver Layer Data Model

This document contains 50 challenging SQL questions designed to test advanced SQL skills on the **complete silver layer Entity-Relationship (ER) data model**. These questions cover all tables and relationships in the silver layer schema, including:

- **Core entities**: `title`, `person`, `role`, `genre`, `title_type`, `region`, `language`, `attribute`
- **Junction tables**: `genre_title`, `title_person_role`, `role_person`
- **Hierarchical structures**: `title_episode` (series and episodes)
- **Localization**: `title_localized` (multi-language and multi-region support)

These questions are suitable for practice exercises and can be used in a RAG system for AI-powered SQL generation.

## Notes for RAG System Implementation

### Query Complexity Indicators
- ⭐⭐⭐ = Moderate complexity (3-5 table joins, basic aggregations)
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐ = High complexity (5-8 table joins, window functions, subqueries)
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ = Very high complexity (recursive CTEs, multiple CTEs, complex business logic)

### Expected Query Patterns
- Most questions require 3-8 table joins
- Window functions are common (RANK, DENSE_RANK, LAG, LEAD, PERCENTILE)
- CTEs are recommended for readability
- Aggregations often need GROUP BY with multiple columns
- Many questions benefit from JSON/array aggregation functions

### Database-Specific Considerations
- These queries are written for a generic SQL dialect
- For Spark SQL, use `collect_list` or `array_agg` for arrays
- For PostgreSQL, use `array_agg` or `jsonb_agg`
- Window functions syntax may vary slightly by database

### Testing Recommendations
1. Start with simpler questions (⭐⭐⭐) to validate schema understanding
2. Test with sample data to ensure queries return expected results
3. Verify performance on large datasets
4. Consider adding indexes on frequently joined columns
5. Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE to optimize query performance

---

## Usage in RAG System

When implementing these questions in a RAG system:

1. **Context Provision**: Include the ERD diagram and schema.yml in the context
2. **Question Categorization**: Tag questions by difficulty and topic
3. **Expected Output Format**: Define clear output schemas for each question
4. **Validation**: Create test cases with expected results
5. **Progressive Difficulty**: Allow users to filter by difficulty level
6. **Hints System**: Provide hints for very difficult questions (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐)
