# movies_analytics
The intention with the project is tp exercise the Data engineering practises. These are the initial thoughts:

-  Domain model: Movies/Series.
-  Data design pattern: Medallion Architecture.
-  Orchestrator and Scheduler: Airflow
-  Cleansing, Validation and Transformation: PySpark
-  Spark Cluster: EMR, Databricks, ... TO DECIDE
-  Data Storage: Iceberg, Snowflake, ... TO DECIDE
-  BI/Data Analytics: ... TO DECIDE

The first approach will be to provision and deploy the data platform in a local environment with docker and eventually 
the intention is to do it in the cloud.
