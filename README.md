# Seventh Art Data Platfom
The intention with the project is tp exercise the Data engineering practises. These are the initial thoughts:

-  Domain model: Movies/Series.
-  Data design pattern: Medallion Architecture.    
-  Orchestrator and Scheduler: Airflow
-  Data transformation: PySpark and DBT
-  Data Storage: Iceberg
-  BI/Data Analytics: TO Decide

The first approach will be to provision and deploy the data platform in a local environment with docker and eventually 
the intention is to do it in the cloud.

This is the current state of the data platform:
